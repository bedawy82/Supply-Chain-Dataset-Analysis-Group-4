## 🗓️ Project Timeline

### 🔹 Week 1 – Data Modeling, Cleaning & Preprocessing
**Tasks:**
- Build a clear **data model** to represent relationships in the dataset.
- Perform **data cleaning** (handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers).
- Conduct **data preprocessing** (type conversion, normalization, and formatting).

**Tools Used:**
- 🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- 🧠 Google Colab
- 🗄️ SQL (for preliminary data exploration)

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned dataset ready for analysis  
- Data preprocessing notebook (`WEEK 1/data_cleaning_and_model.ipynb`)

### 🔹 Week 2 – Analysis Questions Phase
**Tasks:**
- Identify **key analytical questions** that can be answered from the dataset.
- Explore insights related to product categories, revenue, supplier performance, and stock levels.
- Document potential decision-making KPIs.

**Tools Used:**
- 🐍 Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- 📊 SQL queries for insights generation

**Deliverables:**
- Document of analysis questions (`WEEK 2/week2_analysis_questions.md`)
- Visual and exploratory analysis notebooks
